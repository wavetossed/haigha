problem in EventSocket


0.3.1

Removed encoding of arrays as table fields


0.3.0
=====

Test coverage of all protocol and frame classes

Test coverage, bug fixes and minor performance improvements to Reader and 
Writer classes

Reader and Writer conform to RabbitMQ and QPid errata as documented
at http://dev.rabbitmq.com/wiki/Amqp091Errata#section_3. Added 
scripts/rabbit_table_test for integration testing.


0.2.3 
=====

First changelog.

Removed manipulation of channels in Connection.disconnect(). It's now
up to the application to manage channels when explicitly shutting down a
connection or when the socket is dropped and the strategy reconnects. This
fixed a problem wherein an application may have created a connection,
created some channels and queued operations on them, but it takes the
strategy a few attempts before completing a socket connection.

Fixed character escpaing when logging outbound ContentFrames.
